Mouse Follow Animation
A sleek, interactive web animation project that tracks mouse movements to create a dynamic visual effect. Built with pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript, this project demonstrates DOM manipulation, CSS variables, and event handling.

🌟 Features
Real-time Tracking: A custom circular pointer follows the mouse cursor across the screen using mousemove event listeners.

Dynamic Coordinates: Displays live X and Y coordinates of the mouse on the webpage.

Interactive Hover State: The pointer expands and becomes transparent when hovering over specific elements (like the "Hover Me" button).

Smooth Transitions: Uses CSS transition and translate3d for hardware-accelerated, lag-free movement.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure.

CSS3: Custom properties (CSS variables), Flexbox, and animations.

JavaScript (ES6): DOM selection, event listeners, and dynamic style updates.
